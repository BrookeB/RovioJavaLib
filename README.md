@authors Brooke Bosley, Jason Bick & Matthew Barulic

In the process of developing, code that allows the rovio to play scoccer. We noticed that there were very few resources
available for programmming the Wow Wee rovio in Java. With this said we decided to create our on library that fufilled
those needs for us. The purpose of RovioJavaLib, is to allow owners & avid programmers; the ability to program simple commands in Java for there 
rovio. 

This library offers the following methods: moveForward,moveBackward,moveLeft,moveRight,rotateLeft,rotateRight,rotateLeft20,
rotateRight20,diagnolForwardL,diagnolForwardR,diagnolBackwardL,diagnolBackwardR,cameraLow,cameraMid,cameraHigh,startRecording*,stopRecording*,deleteRecording*, 
pauseRecordings*
