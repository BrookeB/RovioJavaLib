@authors Brooke Bosley, Jason Bick & Matthew Barulic

In the process of developing, code that allows the Rovio to play scoccer. we noticed that there were very few resources available for programmming the Wow Wee Rovio in Java. With this said we decided to create our own library that fufilled those needs for us. The purpose of RovioJavaLib, is to allow owners and avid programmers; the ability to program simple commands in Java for their Rovio. 

This library offers the following methods: moveForward,moveBackward,moveLeft,moveRight,rotateLeft,rotateRight,rotateLeft20, rotateRight20,diagnolForwardL,diagnolForwardR,diagnolBackwardL,diagnolBackwardR,cameraLow,cameraMid,cameraHigh,startRecording*,stopRecording*,deleteRecording*,  pauseRecordings*
